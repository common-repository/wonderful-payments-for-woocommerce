== Description ==

###Save big on payment processing!

The Wonderful Payments plugin for UK WooCommerce stores allows merchants to receive **instant bank payments** from their customers; to **slash processing fees**; **remove friction** at checkout; and **improve security**.

Wonderful may be used in conjunction with other payment methods, but introduces a simple, fast and secure payment option where funds **settle instantly** and **directly** to your business bank account.

What’s more, you’re supporting thousands of UK charities at **no additional cost** to you or your customers.


###How much will you save?

Adding the **WooCommerce Plugin** to our **Plus Plan**, gives you a total monthly subscription charge of **£19.99 (plus VAT)**. This includes 2,000 transactions and there are no additional fees. No percentage of transaction fees, no setup fees, nothing else.

That works out at just **1p per transaction** and for any transactions over the two thousand (congratulations by the way!) we charge just **1p per transaction**.


###Delight your customers.

Wonderful’s innovative payment technology introduces a new, vastly improved payment experience. When it’s time to pay, there are no requests for card details; customers simply select their bank and are connected to their mobile banking app to approve a pre-populated, instant payment.

1. Your customer selects their bank.
2. Wonderful seamlessly connects your customer to their mobile banking app.
3. With a couple of taps, your customer authorises a direct, secure payment to your merchant account.

Every transaction is authorised securely by the bank, but with zero data entry from your customers. No sort codes, account numbers, long card numbers or passwords to enter. Once the payment has been authorised, Wonderful automatically redirects the customer back to your WooCommerce for order confirmation.


###OK, how do I get started?

1. First check that we have integrated your business bank > [Full list of supported banks](https://wonderful.co.uk/supported-banks).
2. Next, [register and pay for your first month](https://wonderful.co.uk/get-started?ref=woocommerce_plugin). (If you're not delighted, cancel within seven days for a full refund.)
3. Install and activate the Wonderful Payments for WooCommerce Plugin.


###Why Wonderful?

Not only do Wonderful payments delight customers, eliminate card processing fees and make payments safer, they allow shoppers and merchants to give back to good causes, simply by sending and receiving payments. Since 2016, Wonderful has operated the much-loved charity fundraising platform, Wonderful.org, which provides unlimited donation processing to UK charities at no cost whatsoever. It’s how we got started, and it’s what makes us wonderful! So, whether you’re running a marathon for charity or just selling the trainers, Wonderful makes giving a little easier for everyone.
